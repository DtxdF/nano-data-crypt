# nano-data-crypt
Nano data encrypt and decrypt is small application of  implementation of the functioning of a  system cryptography ( symmetric and  asymmetric key cryptography ) . Application written in Python3.8 to  encrypt data on a small scale, school project for the subject of cibersecurity. 
# Algorithms
  - __AES__
    AES Is Symmetric key cryptography algorithm ( secret key cryptograph ) AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard )
    The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael
  - __RSA__
    Asymmetric key cryptography algorithm based ( public key cryptography and private key cryptography )
    RSA is a public-key cryptographic algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large integers (prime numbers).
    The algorithm is typically used for both encryption and authentication (digital signature).
